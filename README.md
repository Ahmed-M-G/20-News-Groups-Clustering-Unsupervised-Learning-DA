#  20-News-Groups-Clustering-Unsupervised-Learning-DA
 For this code, we will use Scikit-Learnâ€™s API, sklearn. datasets, which allows us to access a famous dataset for linguistic analysis, the 20newsgroups dataset. A newsgroup is an online user discussion group, such as a forum. Sklearn allows us to access different categories of content. We will use texts that have to do with technology, religion, and sport.
